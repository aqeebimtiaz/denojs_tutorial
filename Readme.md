# Deno.js Tutorial

I started this repo to learn about Deno JS.

Primarily I'm following [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gnaJdxuGvEGYQ9iHb8mxsh)'s Tutorial.

Also, I'm following this Traversy Media's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHhiqwcfRM) for a crash course.

For the `master` branch, it's the Traversy Media's one and for The Net Ninja's one will be on another branch.
